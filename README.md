A combination of three serveres

First FastAPI server(main.py) receives JSON and sends it to intermediate websocket server(intermediate.py)
Intermediate websocket server sends it to final websocket server(final.py) 
Final websocket server is processing and returns three messages, which after go back: final->intermediate->main(FastAPI)
Finally, three messages generated by final websocket server get back to client
